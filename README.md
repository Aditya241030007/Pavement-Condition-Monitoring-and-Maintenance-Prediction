# Pavement Condition Monitoring and Maintenance Prediction  

This project is part of my learning in applying **data analysis to civil engineering problems**.  
I used a Kaggle pavement dataset to study road condition indicators and to explore how maintenance needs can be predicted.

## Repository Contents  
- **notebook/** → Jupyter Notebook with the analysis  
- **data/** → placeholder for dataset (not uploaded due to large size ~66 MB)  
- **src/** → space for helper scripts (future work)  
- **requirements.txt** → Python libraries used  
- **README.md** → project description

## Dataset  
The dataset was downloaded from **Kaggle**.  
To run the notebook:  
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle  
2. Save it inside the `data/` folder as:

## What I Did  
- Cleaned and prepared the dataset  
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Visualized pavement condition indicators (PCI, rut depth, IRI, rainfall, AADT)  
- Tried predictive modeling for maintenance needs  
- Documented results step by step in the notebook

## How to Run  
1. Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aditya241030007/Pavement-Condition-Monitoring-and-Maintenance-Prediction.git
cd Pavement-Condition-Monitoring-and-Maintenance-Prediction
